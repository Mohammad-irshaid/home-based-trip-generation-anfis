## 📌 Overview

This repository provides a **research-grade implementation** of:

- Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
- Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)

for modeling **home-based trip generation** as part of the classical **four-step travel demand modeling framework**.

The work reproduces and extends findings from the peer-reviewed publication:

> Irshaid, M., & Abu-Eisheh, S. (2023).  
> *Application of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System in Modelling Home-Based Trip Generation*.  
> Ain Shams Engineering Journal, 14(11), 102523.  
> https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asej.2023.102523

## 🎯 Key Idea

Trip generation is traditionally modeled using linear statistical methods. However, real-world travel behavior is:

- nonlinear  
- uncertain  
- influenced by interacting socioeconomic factors  

This repository investigates whether **ANFIS can better capture behavioral complexity** compared to classical regression models.

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

### 1. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- Stepwise feature selection
- Statistical significance testing
- Multicollinearity diagnostics

### 2. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
- Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy inference system
- Gaussian membership functions
- Hybrid learning:
  - Least Squares Estimation (forward pass)
  - Gradient Descent (backward pass)

---

## 📊 Study Cases

Four trip production categories are modeled:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| HBALL | Total household trips |
| HBW   | Home-based work trips |
| HBE   | Home-based education trips |
| HBO   | Home-based other trips |

---

## 🧾 Dataset

- **Location:** Salfit City, Palestine  
- **Source:** Household travel survey  
- **Sample size:**
  - 256 households (training/calibration)
  - 53 households (validation)

### Input Features

Socioeconomic variables include:
- Household size  
- Employment status  
- Education status  
- Vehicle ownership  
- Income level  
- Household structure

## 📈 Performance Summary

| Model | Method | RMSE | R² |
|------|--------|------|------|
| HBALL | MLR   | 1.7112 | 65.85% |
|      | ANFIS | 1.4880 | 74.18% |
| HBW   | MLR   | 0.5932 | 90.36% |
|       | ANFIS | 0.5465 | 92.74% |
| HBE   | MLR   | 0.4035 | 96.63% |
|       | ANFIS | 0.4020 | 96.66% |
| HBO   | MLR   | 1.5778 | 80.65% |
|       | ANFIS | 1.4419 | 83.94% |

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- ANFIS significantly improves prediction for:
  - HBALL (complex aggregated behavior)
  - HBO (heterogeneous trip purpose)

- MLR performs competitively for:
  - HBW
  - HBE

- Insight:
  > Nonlinear AI models are most beneficial when behavioral complexity increases.
